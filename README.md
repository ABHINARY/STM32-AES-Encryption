# STM32 AES Encryption Project

## Project Overview
This project involves encrypting and transmitting a string using AES encryption on an STM32 microcontroller. The goal is to build a secure communication system between a transmitter and a receiver.

## Tools and Hardware
- STM32 microcontroller  
- AES encryption algorithm  
- C programming language  

## Planned Features
- Implement AES encryption and decryption  
- Transmit encrypted data wirelessly  
- Ensure data integrity and security  

## Timeline
- Week 1-2: Study AES and STM32 basics  
- Week 3-4: Develop encryption and transmission modules  
- Week 5: Testing and debugging
